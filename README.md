# react-pg-auth-demo

This project was made so that I could have a template for configuring authorization, cookies, and protected routes in react, whenever I work on other more complicated projects. Initially I built this so I'd have something to reference as I'm building out the authorization in 'the-eye-tracker' project but I plan to use the logic laid out here for several other projects in the future
